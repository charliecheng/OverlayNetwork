	With great help from Andreea Anghel
	Thanks Andreea!
Usage:
python overlay.py

seeds.txt file needs to be under the same directory

There will be 2 output file:

Log.log: Log file that logs every change of the overlay network. Note that this file will log the change of the Coordinator.
	That means no matter the node is Coordinator or not, only one file is genarated.

Latency.log: Log file that logs the latency of nodes


Under this SVN directory, these files are:
overlay.py	main program
README		ReadMe File
Log.log		an example of Log.log. From this file, all the actions from network is recorded. The Log file is genarated from
		a node, that is a member at beginning, and then turn to be the Coordinatior after the previous Coordinator failure is
		detected. What's more, normal actions like JOIN, LEAVE, FAILURE is shown. The other previous member node's leaving is 			recorded from this new Coordinator.
Latency.log	a Latency log from an American node, with an 1 hour record. Ping interval is 30s.
		The Coordinator is at Zurich(ETH), two members from American(Rice) and HongKong(CUHK)
